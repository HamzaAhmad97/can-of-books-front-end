# Project Name

**Author**: Hamza Ahmad
**Version**: 1.4.0 

## Overview

This is an application where we demonstrate our understanding of routing and authentication, the user will have to login using a service and then he wil get access to the content on the website.

## Getting Started

To build this app, you should have a fair understanding of react, routing, authentication, in addition to some styling.

## Architecture

In this app I have used, React, JavaScript, Auth0, Routers, Bootstrap and react-bootstrap.

## Change Log

- 15/8/2021 > The basic functionality of authentication is established, in addition, the routing is also functioning as expected, needs more styling.

- 16/8/2021 > Added the storage feature but using the GET method which is not optimal, also did some more constructions for new componenets.

- 17/8/2021 > added the feature of adding and deleting books using a form that pops up once you click the button
